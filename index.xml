In the short time Fourier transform domain, we propose an end-to-end narrow-band network that directly takes as input the multi-channel mixture signals of one frequency, and outputs the separated signals of this frequency. In narrow-band, the spatial information (or inter-channel difference) can well discriminate between speakers at different positions. This information is intensively used in many narrow-band speech separation methods, such as beamforming and clustering of spatial vectors.</description></item><item><title>Publication</title><link>https://quancs.github.io/publication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quancs.github.io/publication/</guid><description>2021 [4] Changsheng Quan and Xiaofei Li. 2021.
